(Dec 2018 - Apr 2019)

The task here was to recognize animals and their habitats from a grid of image using Transferred Learning model. I trained the Resnet model for my dataset of animals and habitats. Transferred Learning was done using pytorch.

The data of recognized animals and their respective habitats was passed to the FIREBIRD V robot. A pick and place arm was designed using 3 standard servo motors. An arena was built which was same as the image. FIREBIRD V had to navigate to the places where Box with a particular animal name was kept and had to pick it and place it to its particular habitat place.

Timers were used for interrupts to occur so that I can use encoders of motors. Black Line was followed using White Line Sensors.
