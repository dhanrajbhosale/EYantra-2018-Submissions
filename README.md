In this project, the task was to recognize animals and their habitats from a grid of images using a Transferred Learning model. The Resnet model was trained using pytorch on a dataset comprising animals and their respective habitats. 

The recognized animal data, along with their corresponding habitats, was then passed to the FIREBIRD V robot. A pick and place arm was designed using three standard servo motors. The FIREBIRD V robot was programmed to navigate to specific locations where boxes labeled with particular animal names were placed. The robot would pick up the box and accurately place it in the corresponding habitat location.

Timers were used for interrupts to occur so that I can use encoders of motors. Black Line was followed using White Line Sensors.

Overall, this project showcased the successful implementation of a Transferred Learning model to recognize animals and their habitats, as well as the integration of the FIREBIRD V robot with a pick and place arm for automated handling and placement of animal boxes.
